# Infrapik
 Image manipulator in Javascript using Canvas
 
This Image editor was created initially to manipulate Infrared Photos.

Eventually, through experimentation, it ended up to be a very cool tool for manipulating Photos!

You can play with Presets options, customize and save effects for simple images or webcam feed

To avoid issues with CORS, you can edit & run the "run_local_server.cmd" accordingly to your need
